    If checked, the build will wait for your configured tests to complete (may take 30 seconds to a few minutes) and pass/fail based on the results configured below. If unchecked, your configured tests will run, but the build will not wait for the tests to complete nor fail this step based on any results (useful for historical change logging of your site in the Rigor Optimization application).
